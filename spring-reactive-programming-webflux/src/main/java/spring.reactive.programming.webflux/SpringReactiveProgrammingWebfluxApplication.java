/**
 * This example demonstrates a simple end-to-end Spring Boot application using
 * Spring WebFlux and reactive programming principles. You can expand this by adding
 * error handling, validation, and more complex logic as needed.
 *
 * Reactive Programming
 * Overview: A programming paradigm that focuses on non-blocking, asynchronous data streams. It allows developers to build applications that can react to changes and events in real-time.
 * Key Concepts: It revolves around the idea of observables and observers, where data flows asynchronously and events trigger reactions.
 * Spring WebFlux
 * Overview: A part of Spring that supports reactive programming. It allows developers to build reactive applications using Project Reactor.
 * Features:
 * Non-blocking I/O: Enables handling of a large number of concurrent connections with less resource usage.
 * Reactive Streams: Supports the reactive streams specification, providing a standard for asynchronous stream processing.
 * Example Use Cases
 * Web Applications: Building responsive web applications that can handle a large number of users concurrently.
 * APIs: Creating RESTful APIs that return data asynchronously, improving performance and scalability.
 * Real-time Applications: Applications like chat systems or live notifications that require real-time data updates.
